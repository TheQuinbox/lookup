## Introduction.

Lookup is a fully accessible tool, that puts tons of information just a few key presses away. Some highlights include:

* Just sits in the background until you need it.
* Very light on system resources.
* Very user-friendly interface.
* 100% accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies.
* And a lot more!

Currently, Look up can:

* Get forismatic quotes.
* Get advice slips.
* Define words.
* Search Urban Dictionary.

## Main window.

The main window is fairly simple, only containing a few controls. They are:

* A combo box where you choose what you want to do.
* A "Go" button. Press this to carry out the selected action.
* The "Close" button. Use this to exit the application. It's worth noting this is the only way to exit, alt+f4 hides the window.
