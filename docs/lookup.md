## Main window.

The main window is fairly simple, only containing a few controls. They are:

* A combo box where you choose what you want to do.
* A "Go" button. Press this to carry out the selected action.
* The "Close" button. Use this to exit the application. It's worth noting this is the only way to exit, alt+f4 hides the window.
